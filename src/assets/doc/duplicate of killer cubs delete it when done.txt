The Story as we know it...

Have you heard about the legend around these parts about Little Jay?  As the story goes... Very little is known, but as far as we can gather, "Little Jay" was said to be found at the lake in a cabin next to a severed womans head.  He was visiously discarded and left there, surrounded by other negleted old toys and furniture that looked like they were there since 1971.  

You see... some teddy bears come from loving happy homes.

But some unfortunate little souls come from the most horrible homes imaginable.

Little Jay was spawned from hell and recentment.  Resenting all of those happy little teddy bears and vowing to kill each and everyone of them that cross his path.

If you have a teddy bear and you live deep in the woods, I would be very careful Little Jay doesn't come pay you and your happy loving little teddy bear a visit that neither of you will ever forget...
